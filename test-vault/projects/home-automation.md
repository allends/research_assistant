# Home Automation

Exploring smart home setups with Home Assistant, ESPHome, and Zigbee devices.

## Current Setup

- **Hub:** Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi 4
- **Protocol:** Zigbee via Sonoff ZBDongle-P
- **Devices:** 12 smart bulbs, 3 motion sensors, 2 door sensors, 1 thermostat

## Ideas

- Build a custom ESPHome sensor for [[health|air quality monitoring]]
- Automate lighting based on time of day and occupancy
- Create dashboards for energy usage tracking
- Integrate with [[reading-list]] to suggest ambient lighting for reading sessions

## Notes

Put this project on hold to focus on [[research-assistant]]. Will revisit once the RA MVP is done.

The automation scripts use YAML configuration — very different from the TypeScript work in my other projects. See [[typescript-patterns]] for contrast.
