## Work

Finished [[research-assistant]] Phase 1! All commands (`init`, `search`, `index`) are working. TypeScript types are clean — `tsc --noEmit` passes.

### Completed Today

- CLI skeleton with Commander.js
- `search` command with `--mode keyword|semantic|hybrid`
- `index` command with `--update` and `--status`
- `init` command with vault validation and QMD setup
- Terminal formatter with colored output
- Logger utility

## Planning

Next up is Phase 2: Agent SDK integration. Need to:

1. Install `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`
2. Define MCP tools using `tool()` + `createSdkMcpServer()`
3. Implement the `ask` command
4. Figure out the MCP tool naming convention (`mcp__<server>__<tool>`)

See [[research-assistant]] for the full plan.

## Reading

Added [[article-clip]] about transformer attention mechanisms. Relevant to understanding how embedding models work for [[vector-search]].
