# Monday, February 10, 2026

## Morning

Started the day reviewing [[research-assistant]] architecture. Decided to use Commander.js for the CLI framework — it's mature and well-documented. Considered citty as a lighter alternative but Commander has better TypeScript support.

## Work

- Implemented the config system for `~/.research-assistant/config.json`
- Got the QMD wrapper working — `search()`, `vsearch()`, and `query()` all return parsed JSON
- The [[obsidian-plugin-api]] docs were helpful for understanding the eval interface

### Debugging Note

Ran into an issue with `Bun.spawn` where stderr wasn't being captured correctly. Fixed by reading stderr as a stream rather than using `.text()` directly. Something to remember for [[typescript-patterns]].

## Evening

Read a chapter on [[vector-search|vector similarity search]] — HNSW vs IVF trade-offs. QMD uses sqlite-vec which is flat/brute-force for now but works fine at vault scale (< 100k docs).
