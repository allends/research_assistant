## Work

Continued [[research-assistant]] Phase 1 implementation.

- Built the Obsidian CLI wrapper with graceful degradation
- Implemented vault filesystem fallback — reads notes directly via `gray-matter`
- Added `extractWikilinks()` and `extractTags()` utilities

The Obsidian CLI is still Early Access and some commands have quirky parameter parsing. Wrapped everything in try/catch so the tool degrades gracefully when Obsidian isn't running.

## Research

Explored the [[obsidian-plugin-api]] eval interface more deeply. You can access `app.metadataCache.resolvedLinks` to get the full link graph in one call — much faster than parsing markdown files individually.

## Thoughts

The [[programming]] area is getting messy. Need to reorganize — maybe split into languages (TypeScript, Python) and concepts (architecture, testing, patterns).

Captured a [[fleeting-thought]] about using embeddings for automatic tag suggestions.
