# Health & Wellness

Tracking health habits, exercise routines, and wellness goals.

## Exercise Routine

### Current Plan (Winter 2026)

- **Monday/Wednesday/Friday:** Strength training (45 min)
- **Tuesday/Thursday:** Running (30 min, easy pace)
- **Saturday:** Long run or hike
- **Sunday:** Rest or yoga

### Goals

- [ ] Run a half marathon by June 2026
- [ ] Bench press bodyweight by April 2026
- [x] Consistent 3x/week strength training

## Nutrition

Focusing on whole foods, adequate protein (1g/lb), and hydration.

Meal prep on Sundays helps with consistency — similar to how batch processing helps with [[programming|software engineering]] workflows.

## Sleep

Target: 7.5 hours per night. Using sleep tracking to identify patterns.

Key insight: screen time before bed (especially coding on [[research-assistant]] late at night) significantly impacts sleep quality. Setting a hard cutoff at 10pm.

## Mental Health

- Daily journaling (see daily notes in [[2026-02-10|daily notes]])
- Regular breaks during coding sessions (Pomodoro technique)
- Outdoor time — walking meetings, park runs

The [[home-automation]] project includes ambient lighting that adjusts color temperature in the evening to support better sleep.
